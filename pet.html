    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hi. I'm a dog. Everybody tells me I'm a Boston Terrier, but I don't get it. First, I'm Moose. Second, I'm not in Boston. Third, I like to be described as an <em>Earth</em> Terrier to avoid the confusion.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>My Family</h2>
      <p>My mom's name is 'Bark.' That's dog for 'Mom, feed me'. My dad's name is 'Bark B-Bark' which means 'Big Doge' in dog. I don't normally call them by those name because I don't actually like to bark. Oh, and I have two sisters that meow instead of bark. They're really annoying, and not anything like me besides the four legged part and how much they like to eat my precious food. <br><br>**Don't worry, I eat their food first**</p>

    <h2>My Favorite Toys</h2>
